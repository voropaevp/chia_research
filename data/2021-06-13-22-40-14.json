Though I soon realised after a weeks farming / plotting that the chances of winning are ZERO, so stopped plotting chia on the 14th of May which is where my plot count has remained static at 142, or 14tb of storage used as the maths does not stack up! Furthermore 2 weeks on my decision to stop farming proved correct as the ponzi game that CHIA is became apparent, one of a mass of un farmed coins that will go into an IPO, CHIA INC, so as to get the fools on Wall Street to plow $100 billion into in valuation terms thus allowing the CHIA insiders to cash out with billions all without selling a single CHIA coin!\n\nMeanwhile the suckers, that's you are expected to keep expanding that network space so that the CHIA IPO can carry the greatest value. Anyone who feeds the network space with their hard drives is a fool who has fallen prey to the CHIA Crypto scam that I am sure in years to come will be investigated by the likes of 60 minutes and Panorama in the UK.\n\nAT LEAST NOW YOU CAN'T SAY I DID NOT WARN YOU ALL!\n\nFor GPU mining check out Nicehash  https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=ac837076-4031-408d-a8be-d68ec1994adc\n\nFor crypto trading and investing  see Binance https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=LZ728VLZ\n\nFor managing your crypto's see Coinbase https://www.coinbase.com/join/walaya_dq\n\nWhilst best CPUs and hard drives on Amazon UK https://amzn.to/3om3kFP US https://amzn.to/2LalewD\n\nAs for a what I consider to be a good GPU for mining then go for the Asus TUF Gaming O/C, though of course there is the stock issue.

This is the story of many fellow farmers.\n\nI go through how I set up my machines and the progress I have made so far. Finally, I answer the question whether solo mining is worth it at this point. There is no simple answer to this, but to be straightforward, if you are starting with this today, I suggest waiting until the official pooling protocol comes out.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video!

Initially it had the noble goal of making a democratic, decentralised and trustless blockchain by leveraging unused CPU power. This sadly didn't turn out as expected as Bitcoin is now mainly mined by a few big ASIC miner farms.\n\nChia wants to re-ignite this noble goal by and improved Nakamoto consensus system: Proof of Space and Time\n\nSo instead of consuming massive amounts of electricity to mine a block, you simply \"farm\" your plots and hereby leverage the exabytes of disk space that already exist in the world and are left unused. Sadly this is only half of the story, in order to stay competetive, you'll have to generate new plots faster then the network is growing. Otherwise your chances of winning a block decrease. This takes away part of the green element as the best way to create plots is using a strong CPU (which runs close to 100%) and very fast NVME drivers which have a limited lifecycle and which will have to replaced within a year (cheap ones within 2 months of Chia mining).\n\nUseful links:\n- Chia website: https://www.chia.net/\n- Chia Calculator: https://chiacalculator.com/\n- Whitepaper: https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia-Business-Whitepaper-2021-02-09-v1.0.pdf\n- Coinbase link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chia\n\nUseful resources on Chia:\n- @Sloth Tech TV  : ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DMmerPR7Y\n- @Coin Breakthrough : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi6c6gqIi7Qe18lZIF98JCQ\n- @der8auer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xChp7iSQ4Mg\n- @Seth Estrada : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jexCLI_lorQ&t=2s\n\n#chia #chiamining #bitcoin\n\nLet's get on that crypto train!\n\nBren\n\n**************************************************\nUSEFUL LINKS (using these links supports the channel)\n**************************************************\nNew to crypto?

This is the question that lots of users who are are getting ready to purchase or upgrade their data storage solutions in 2021 are asking. From hard drives to SSD, from NAS to DAS, availability and lead times on even arguably mundane areas of storage have begun to thin out considerably, whilst the price tag on most of this hardware has started to noticeably rise. It would be remarkably easy to just point a finger at the pandemic and say that's why it's happening and indeed the global pandemic that still continues to varying degrees has played a part, but there are other key reasons for hardware shortages in storage technology right now. These range from environmental to economical, and even social-political reasons too, all of which are now being felt by the consumer in a big, BIG way. So today I wanted to go through each of the biggest impacting reasons for these hardware and chip-centered shortages and why we are going to continue to feel this pinch until 2022 and maybe 2023.\n\nNASCompares Free Advice Area - https://nascompares.com/contact-us/\n\nThanks for watching.

However, even though Innosilicon bailed on releasing a public G32 GRIN ASIC miner iPollo has seized the opportunity to bring GRIN ASIC miners to market, they have apparently created a full-size iPollo G1 miner that mines over $200 a day as well as this iPollo G1 mini that mines an impressive $10 a day worth of Grincoin while hardly consuming any electricity!

This is what I do and I do not recommend anyone else do anything because they watched one of my YouTube videos.\nBecause these apps work for me does not mean they will for you. With most paying apps the are many variables to consider if the application is not working for you. First and foremost is the date. The date this app is filmed the application is working fine, but anything could happen in the future. The application could change it's terms of service, stop paying or even disappear. You are never guaranteed to get paid. But as for now and the date of this video the app is working for me. Other than the date, your location, phone, phone service provider & more are to be considered if the app is not working for you. Now that we got that out the way. Happy Earnings!!!

All of the value in these protocols is concentrated in the application layer. There is no value that accrues to the protocol layer. This is different in the case of Ethereum where the network benefits from dApp use\n\nYou also have Metcalfe's law that dictates the value of a network is proportional to the square of users on it. So, it is essentially an exponential functoin of all the users on the network\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 ETH Demand \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRecently, Ethereum network demand has been surging. You only need take a look at the total number of active addresses on the Ethereum network. This is at an all time high at over 580,000 addresses\n\nThis is being drive by\n\n- Defi: Thousands of dApps with over 50 billion in TVL\n- Stablecoin Demand: Billions has been issued on the Ethereum Network\n- NFTs: These are all minted on the Ethereum network and requries gas in order to do it. \n\nAll of these factors add to the argument of ETH value according to the Fat protocol as well as Metcalfe's law. \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Layer 2 Scaling \ud83d\udcc8\n\nGiven that there was a delay in the Optimism scaling solution there has been some concerns about ETH scaling. However, there are a number of other really important layer 2 solutions out there. \n\nPolygon have developed a child chain architecture that leverages zkRollups and Optimistic rollups. Polygon childchains will be able to leverage the security, robustness, and network effects of the Ethereum blockchain.  \n\nGiven that this is layer 2 it means that scaling can be done off of the main chain. As more Etheruem dApps start to integrate with Polygon it will mean less bloat on the main network.\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 EIP 1559 & Proof of Stake \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\n\nThis is a change in the way that the Ethereum Gas fee auction market works. It will see the implementation of a standardised \"base fee\" and an optional Tip that can be paid to speed up transactions. \n\nNow, while EIP-1559 may not nessecarily reduce gas fees per se, it will make them more *predictable* and easier to use. You won't need to adjust gas limits based on current market conditions as the Base fee will be dynamically adjusted. \n\nGiven that Miners are not a fan of EIP1559, they threatened to stage rebellion. This led to efforts by some in the ETH community to to hurry along the Proof of Stake merge. This would happen in Phase 1 which would mean that Ethereum could scale much quicker.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Price Potential \ud83d\udcb8\n\nThere are many factors that are price positive for ETH. These include both demand and supply factors:\n\n- Increasing utility demand\n- Increasing invesment demand\n- Decreasing Exchange Supply\n- More ETH in Defi Smart Contracts\n- More ETH in the ETH 2.0 deposit contract\n- potential impact of Fee burns\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\ud83d\udcdc Disclaimer \ud83d\udcdc\n\nThe information contained herein is for informational purposes only.
